# AI Red Teaming Workshop

AI Red Teaming Workshop material.

This workshop deploys an Azure AI Foundry hub & project, a traditional Azure Machine Learning workspace, and supporting resources (Storage, Key Vault, App Insights, Container Registry, Cognitive Services) to provide an environment for running Azure AI red teaming evaluations.

> Workshop execution environment: Notebooks (e.g., `AIRT.ipynb`) are expected to run on the provisioned Azure ML **compute instance** (remote kernel) created by the template. This provides a consistent, RBAC-enabled environment and avoids local machine dependency drift. You can run locally, but screenshots, timing, and identity assumptions in the modules all target the managed compute scenario.

> **Avg deployment time: ~15 min**
>
> Note: The template also provisions a compute instance in the traditional workspace (assigned to the provided user objectId) and assigns necessary storage roles. No manual compute creation is required.

## Pre‑Deploy Steps

1. Obtain your current user's Microsoft Entra ID (AAD) Object ID using Cloud Shell (Bash). You will use this in the deployment parameter below.

```bash
az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv
```

2. Ensure you deploy to East US 2 region, only a select few regions are supported [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/run-scans-ai-red-teaming-agent#region-support)

## Post‑Install Steps

### Assign Blob Contributor Permissions (User)

Be sure to apply the RBAC role to the *user* at the **Resource Group** scope. This allows the signed-in user to connect to both storage accounts and upload the notebook files for AI red teaming evaluations.

⚠️ You must assign the role **Storage Blob Data Contributor** at the Resource Group. (The template already assigns identities/roles for the compute instance; this step is for your interactive user.)

1. Go to the Azure AI Foundry hub resource and launch Azure AI Studio.
2. In the hub, open the Connected resources blade; click each storage connection to update from SAS to Microsoft Entra ID. ![Update hub store 1](./images/updateaihubstore1.png)
3. Edit the Access details. ![Update hub store 2](./images/updateaihubstore2.png)
4. Change the authentication type from SAS to Microsoft Entra ID and click Save. ![Update hub store 3](./images/updateaihubstore3.png)
5. Repeat for the other storage connection.
6. Download from GitHub the [files folder](https://github.com/swiftsolves-msft/AI-Red-team-evaluations-workshop/tree/main/workshop/files) locally (used later in the Machine Learning workspace). ![Files to download](./images/filestodownload.png)
7. Navigate to the Machine Learning workspace Azure resource and launch Studio. ![Launch ML Studio](./images/mlworkportal.png)
8. In Machine Learning Studio, open the Notebooks blade and click Upload folder. ![Upload notebooks](./images/mlnotebook.png)
9. Select and upload the `data` folder (with `prompts.json`) and the `AIRT.ipynb` notebook. ![Upload notebook](./images/mlnotebook2.png)
10. Ensure the directory structure contains a `data` folder with `prompts.json` and the `AIRT.ipynb` notebook in the root. ![Notebook directory](./images/mlnotebook3.png)
11. When opening `AIRT.ipynb`, authenticate if prompted in the upper-right corner. ![SDK auth 1](./images/authsdk.png) ![SDK auth 2](./images/authsdk2.png)

### Recommended Authentication Approach

While the notebook examples may show using an API key, prefer Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) token-based auth (e.g., `DefaultAzureCredential`) for production or shared environments. Store secrets outside source control (e.g., Azure Key Vault) and avoid committing `.env`.

If using the Azure OpenAI SDK in Python:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.openai import AzureOpenAI

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = AzureOpenAI(
    api_version="2024-12-01-preview",
    azure_endpoint="https://<your-openai-account>.openai.azure.com/",
    credential=credential
)
```

Create a `.env.example` (not committed) for workshop convenience; then copy to `.env` locally.
